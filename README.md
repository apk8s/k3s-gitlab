# k3s + Gitlab

This document outlines the steps for utilizing [k3s] to manage a self-hosted [Gitlab] instance. This may be beneficial for individuals and organizations already leveraging [Kubernetes] for platform development. Many applications such as [Gitlab] do not need sophisticated compute clusters to operate, yet [k3s] allows us to achieve additional continuity in the management of development operations. [k3s], although slim-down, is a fully functional [Kubernetes]. 

Containers have made applications like [Gitlab] incredibly portable, [Kubernetes] brings that portability to container management and [k3s] makes that portability available at the smallest of scale.

This document outlines a process for setting up a Gitlab instance in a single custom node Kubernetes ([k3s]) cluster on [Vultr].  However, there is very little difference in utilizing other vendors, such as [Digital Ocean] or [Linode].

**Disclosure**: Links to [Vultr], [Digital Ocean] and [Linode] are affiliate links and credit my accounts on those services if you sign up. Affiliate credit helps me offset the expense of setting up environments for developing articles and tutorials. I do not endorse any of these vendors specifically; however, they are all great choices if you are looking for alternatives or redundancies to Google, Amazon, or Microsoft. [Kubernetes] is a Cloud Native and Vendor Neutral solution, and if implemented well, the specific vendor should only be a high-level business concern. 

## Obtain a Server (or VM Instance)

This document utilizes one **Los Angeles** instance of a **2 CPU / 4096MB Memory** **[Ubuntu 18.04] x64** server on [Vultr] with Private Networking enabled and a "Server Hostname & Label" of **gitlab.apk8s.dev**. At the time of this writing, the instance cost is $20/mo, or 3 cents per hour.

![Server Location](https://github.com/apk8s/k3s-gitlab/blob/master/assets/v01-server-location.png?raw=true)

![Server Type](https://github.com/apk8s/k3s-gitlab/blob/master/assets/v02-server-type.png?raw=true)

![Server Size](https://github.com/apk8s/k3s-gitlab/blob/master/assets/v03-server-size.png?raw=true)

![Server Hostname](https://github.com/apk8s/k3s-gitlab/blob/master/assets/v04-server-hostname.png?raw=true)

## Configure DNS

Add DNS `A` records for your domain, such as: **gitlab.apk8s.dev** and ***.gitlab.apk8s.dev** pointed to the public IP address of the [Vultr] instance above. See your Domain Name / DNS provider for instructions on adding `A` records.

## Prepare Server

Login to the new server (IP) as the root user:

```bash
ssh root@NEW_SERVER_IP
```

Upgrade any outdated packages:

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

## Install [k3s]

[k3s] is "Easy to install. A binary of less than 40 MB. Only 512 MB of RAM required to run." this allows us to utilized Kubernetes for managing the Gitlab application container on a single node while limited the footprint of Kubernetes itself. 

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

[k3s] is now installed and the [Kubernetes] API is listening on the public IP of the server through port **6443**. 

## Remote Access with `kubectl`

From your local workstation you should be able to issue a [curl] command to Kubernetes:

```bash
curl --insecure https://SERVER_IP:6443/
```

The new [k3s] cluster should return a **401 Unauthorized** response with the following payload:

```json
{
  "kind": "Status",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {

  },
  "status": "Failure",
  "message": "Unauthorized",
  "reason": "Unauthorized",
  "code": 401
}
```

[k3s] credentials are stored on the server at `/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml`:

Review the contents of the generated `k8s.yml` file:

```bash
cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
```

The `k3s.yaml` is a Kubernetes config file used by `kubectl` and contains (1) one cluster, (3) one user and a (2) context that ties them together. `kubectl` uses [contexts] to determine the cluster you wish to connect to and use for access credentials. The `current-context` section is the name of the context currently selected with the `kubectl config use-context` command.


![k3s.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apk8s/k3s-gitlab/master/diagrams/k3s-yaml.jpg)

Ensure that [kubectl] is installed on your local workstation.

If you have [kubectl] installed on your local workstation, notice that the `k8s.yml` file on the new [k3s] node is a `kubectl` config file similar to the file `~/.kube/config` generated by `kubectl`.  

You can copy the entire `k8s.yml` file over to `~/.kube/config` if you have not other contexts there already, it may also be a good practice to rename the **cluster**, **user** and **context** from `default` to something more descriptive. 

If you already have clusters, user and contexts in your `~/.kube/config` you can add these new entries after renaming them. 

Another option is to create another file such as `~/.kube/gitlab-config` and set the **KUBECONFIG** environment variable to point to it. Read more about `kubectl` [configuration options][contexts].

![kubectl config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apk8s/k3s-gitlab/master/diagrams/kubectl-config.jpg)

Before you being configuring [k3s] make sure `kubectl` pointed to the correct cluster: 

```bash
kubectl config use-context gitlab-admin
```

Ensure that you can communicate with the new [k3s] cluster by requesting a list of nodes:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

If successful, you should get output similar to the following:

```bash
NAME               STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION
gitlab.apk8s.dev   Ready    <none>   171m   v1.14.1-k3s.4
```

## Install [Cert Manager] / [Let's Encrypt]

[Gitlab] ships with [Let's Encrypt] capabilities, however, since we are running Gitlab through [k3s] (Kubernetes) [Ingress] (using [Traefik],) we need to generate Certs and provide TLS from the cluster. 

Create Cert Manager's Custom Resource Definitions: 
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jetstack/cert-manager/release-0.8/deploy/manifests/00-crds.yaml
```

Install [Cert Manager] with the [./k8s/0000-global/001-cert-manager-helm.yml](./k8s/0000-global/001-cert-manager-helm.yml) manifest (the [k3s] way):

```bash
kubectl create -f ./k8s/0000-global/001-cert-manager-helm.yml 
```

Ensure that cert manager is now running:
```bash
kubectl get all -n cert-manager
```

Output:
```plain

```


Add a [ClusterIssuer] to handle the generation of Certs cluster-wide:

***NOTE:** First edit [./k8s/0000-global/005-clusterissuer.yml](./k8s/0000-global/005-clusterissuer.yml) and replace **YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS** with your email address.

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./k8s/0000-global/005-clusterissuer.yml 
```

## Install Gitlab

### Namespace

[./k8s/1000-gitlab/000-namespace/000-namespace.yml](./k8s/1000-gitlab/000-namespace/000-namespace.yml) creates the [Namespace] `gitlab`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./k8s/1000-gitlab/000-namespace/000-namespace.yml
```

### TLS Certificate

Generate a TLS Certificate (first edit [./k8s/1000-gitlab/000-namespace/010-certs.yml](./k8s/1000-gitlab/000-namespace/010-certs.yml) and replace **apk8s.dev** with your domain):

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./k8s/1000-gitlab/000-namespace/010-certs.yml
```

### Services

[./k8s/1000-gitlab/100-gitlab/10-service.yml](./k8s/1000-gitlab/100-gitlab/10-service.yml) creates two **[Services]**. Service **gitlab** provides a backend service for [Ingress] to serve the Gitlab web UI. Service **gitlab-tcp** exposes port **32222** for interacting with Gitlab over ssh for operations such as git clone, push and pull.

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./k8s/1000-gitlab/100-gitlab/10-service.yml
```

### Deployment

[./k8s/1000-gitlab/100-gitlab/40-deployment.yml](./k8s/1000-gitlab/100-gitlab/40-deployment.yml) creates a Gitlab **[Deployment]**.

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./k8s/1000-gitlab/100-gitlab/40-deployment.yml
```

The Gitlab deployment launches a single [Pod] creating and mounting the directory `/srv/gitlab/` on the new server for the persistent storage for configuration, logs, and data (Git repos.) containers (registry) and uploads.

```yaml
        - name: config-volume
          hostPath:
            path: /srv/gitlab/config
        - name: logs-volume
          hostPath:
            path: /srv/gitlab/logs
        - name: data-volume
          hostPath:
            path: /srv/gitlab/data
        - name: reg-volume
          hostPath:
            path: /srv/gitlab/reg
        - name: uploads-volume
          hostPath:
            path: /srv/gitlab/uploads
```

### Configure Gitlab

Gitlab may take a minute or more to boot. Once Gitlab is running locate the newly generated config file gitlab.rb on the server at `/srv/gitlab/config/gitlab.rb`. 

The initial `gitlab.rb` file is commented out sample configuration so you may simply back it up and add a new file with the following. Replace **.apk8s.dev** with your domain.

`/srv/gitlab/config/gitlab.rb`:
```ruby
external_url 'https://gitlab.apk8s.dev'

nginx['listen_port'] = 80
nginx['listen_https'] = false
nginx['proxy_set_headers'] = {
  'X-Forwarded-Proto' => 'https',
  'X-Forwarded-Ssl' => 'on'
}

gitlab_rails['gitlab_shell_ssh_port'] = 32222

registry_external_url 'https://reg.gitlab.apk8s.dev'

gitlab_rails['registry_enabled'] = true

registry_nginx['listen_port'] = 5050
registry_nginx['listen_https'] = false
registry_nginx['proxy_set_headers'] = {
  'X-Forwarded-Proto' => 'https',
  'X-Forwarded-Ssl' => 'on'
}

prometheus['monitor_kubernetes'] = false
```

### Ingress

The Kubernetes [Ingress] manifest [./k8s/1000-gitlab/100-gitlab/50-ingress.yml](./k8s/1000-gitlab/100-gitlab/50-ingress.yml) sets up [Traefik] to direct requests to the host **gitlab.apk8s.dev** to backend [Service] named **gitlab**.

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./k8s/1000-gitlab/100-gitlab/50-ingress.yml
```

## Login

Browse to https://gitlab.apk8s.dev (replace top-level domain with your domain). **NOTE:** New [Gitlab] installs present a screen to set the admin (**root**) user's password. **Do this immediately** to prevent someone else from setting up Gitlab for you. 

## Note

Remember to keep the directory `/srv/gitlab` on the server backed up.
