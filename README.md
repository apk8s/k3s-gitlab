# k3s Gitlab

Utilizing [k3s] to manage a self-hosted [Gitlab] instance is for individuals and organizations already leveraging [Kubernetes] for development and production platform development. Many applications such as [Gitlab] do not need sophisticated compute clusters to operate, yet [k3s] allows us to achieve continuity in the management of all development operations. [k3s], although slim-down is a fully functional [Kubernetes]. Containers have made applications like [Gitlab] incredibly portable, [Kubernetes] brings that portability to container management and [k3s] makes that portability available at smallest of scale.

This document outlines a process for setting up a Gitlab instance in a single custom node Kubernetes ([k3s]) cluster on [Vultr].  However, there is very little difference in utilizing other vendors, such as [Digital Ocean] or [Linode].

**Disclosure**: Links to [Vultr], [Digital Ocean] and [Linode] are affiliate links and credit my accounts on those services if you sign up. Affiliate credit helps me offset the expense of setting up environments for developing articles and tutorials. I do not endorse any of these vendors specifically; however, they are all great choices if you are looking for alternatives or redundancies to Google, Amazon, or Microsoft. [Kubernetes] is a Cloud Native and Vendor Neutral solution, and if implemented well, the specific vendor should only be a high-level business concern. 

## Obtain a Server (or VM Instance)

This document utilizes one **Los Angeles** instance of a **2 CPU / 4096MB Memory** **[Ubuntu 18.04] x64** server on [Vultr] with Private Networking enabled and a "Server Hostname & Label" of **gitlab.apk8s.dev**. At the time of this writing, the instance cost is $20/mo, or 3 cents per hour.

## Configure DNS

DNS `A` records are added **gitlab.apk8s.dev** and ***.gitlab.apk8s.dev** and pointed to the public IP address of the [Vultr] instance. See you DNS provider for instructions for adding `A` records.

## Prepare Server

Login to the new server (IP) as the root user.

```bash
ssh root@IP
```

Upgrade any outdated packages:

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

## Install [k3s]

[k3s] is "Easy to install. A binary of less than 40 MB. Only 512 MB of RAM required to run." this allows us to utilized Kubernetes for managing the Gitlab application container on a single node while limited the footprint of Kubernetes itself. 

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

[k3s] is now installed and the [Kubernetes] API is listening on the public IP of the server on port **6443**. 

## Remote Access with `kubectl`

From your local workstation you should be able to issue a [curl] command to Kubernetes:

```bash
curl --insecure https://SERVER_IP:6443/
```

The new [k3s] cluster should return a **401 Unauthorized** response with the following payload:

```json
{
  "kind": "Status",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {

  },
  "status": "Failure",
  "message": "Unauthorized",
  "reason": "Unauthorized",
  "code": 401
}
```

[k3s] credentials are stored on the server at `/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml`:

Review the contents of the generated `k8s.yml` file:

```bash
cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
```

The `k3s.yaml` is a Kubernetes config file used by `kubectl` and contains (1) one cluster, (3) one user and a (2) context that ties them together. `kubectl` uses [contexts] to determine the cluster you wish to connect to and use for access credentials. The `current-context` section is the name of the context currently selected with the `kubectl config use-context` command.

Ensure that [kubectl] is installed on your local workstation.

If you have [kubectl] installed on your local workstation, notice that the `k8s.yml` file on the new [k3s] node is a `kubectl` config file similar to the file `~/.kube/config` generated by `kubectl`.  

You can copy the entire `k8s.yml` file over to `~/.kube/config` if you have not other contexts there already, it may also be a good practice to rename the **cluster**, **user** and **context** from `default` to something more descriptive. 

If you already have clusters, user and contexts in your `~/.kube/config` you can add these new entries after renaming them. 

Another option is to create another file such as `~/.kube/gitlab-config` and set the **KUBECONFIG** environment variable to point to it. Read more about `kubectl` [configuration options][contexts].

![](diagrams/kubectl-config.jpg)

Before you being configuring [k3s] make sure `kubectl` pointed to the correct cluster: 

```bash
kubectl config use-context gitlab-admin
```

Ensure that you are able to communicate with the new [k3s] cluster by requesting a list of nodes:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

If successful you should get output similar to the following:

```bash
NAME               STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION
gitlab.apk8s.dev   Ready    <none>   171m   v1.14.1-k3s.4
```
